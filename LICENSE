## About This License

The MIT License is one of the most permissive and popular open-source licenses.
It allows you to:

✅ Use the software for any purpose (commercial or personal)
✅ Modify the source code as you see fit
✅ Distribute copies of the original or modified software
✅ Sublicense the software
✅ Sell copies of the software

The only requirement is that you include the original copyright notice and
license text in any copy or substantial portion of the software.

## Why MIT License?

We chose the MIT License for Harbor Docker Learning because:

1. **Educational Mission**: We want this project to be freely used by students,
   educators, and developers worldwide without restrictions.

2. **Maximum Freedom**: The MIT License allows anyone to use, modify, and even
   commercialize the software while keeping it open source.

3. **Simple & Clear**: Unlike more complex licenses (GPL, Apache), the MIT
   License is easy to understand for beginners.

4. **Industry Standard**: Many popular open-source projects use MIT, making it
   familiar and trusted in the developer community.

5. **No Copyleft**: Unlike GPL, MIT doesn't require derivative works to remain
   open source, giving users maximum flexibility.

## Educational Note

This license exemplifies the open-source philosophy:
- Share knowledge freely
- Build on others' work
- Contribute back to the community
- Enable innovation through collaboration

Just as ships in a harbor benefit from shared infrastructure, software projects
thrive when knowledge is openly shared!
